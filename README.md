# RFP

The Resource Finder Project aims at gathering resources as ontologies, then aligning them to fetch them by queries later.

## Usage

It isn't very practical for production yet but tests can be achieved easily.

First compile the Java back-end by running ant into the src/java/ directory .
Java 8 is needed.

Then you can deploy the website simply by running PHP with its root directory being set as src/ .

Uploaded resources ontologies and alignments will be stored in the src/uploads directory.
